This study shows that {WM} modulates the degree of attribution of one's own knowledge to others' mental states. Participants were asked to read a story twice (Experiment 2) or as carefully as possible (Experiment 3) and to estimate the probability percentages of possible choices for a naive protagonist's behavior. The participants were then asked to maintain either a two- or seven-letter alphabet string (i.e., a light or heavy {WM} load, respectively) during the probability estimation but not during the story comprehension. The results showed that compared to the participants with a light {WM} load, those with a heavy {WM} load estimated a signiﬁcantly higher probability of the choice indicating that the protagonist would behave on the basis of a fact that the participants knew but the protagonist did not. This result indicates that {WM} moderates the extent to which adults attribute their own knowledge to others' mental states. The role of {WM} in theory of mind and in heuristic strategy for making probability judgments was then discussed.},

This study examined the extent to which ‘Self’ and ‘Other’ belief-attribution processes within the Theory of Mind ({ToM}) mechanism could be distinguished behaviourally, and whether these separable components differentially related to Executive Functioning ({EF}) abilities. A computerized false-belief task, utilizing a matched-design to allow direct comparison of self-oriented vs. other-oriented belief-attribution, was used to assess {ToM}, and a face-image Stroop task was employed to assess {EF}, within a population of typically-developed adults. Results revealed signiﬁcantly longer reaction times when attributing beliefs to other people as opposed to recognizing and attributing beliefs to oneself. Intriguingly, results revealed that ‘perspective-shift’ requirements (i.e. changing from adoption of the ‘self’ perspective to the perspective of the ‘other’, or vice versa) across false-belief trials inﬂuenced reaction times. Reaction times were signiﬁcantly longer when the perspective shift was from self-to-other than from other-to-self. It is suggested that the ‘self’ forms the stem of understanding the ‘other’, and is therefore processed regardless of ultimate task demands; in contrast, the ‘other’ perspective is only processed when explicitly required. We conclude that adopting another person’s perspective, even when their belief state is matched to one’s own, requires more cognitive effort than recalling and reﬂecting on self-oriented belief-states.},

Yet, to date, no research examines whether perspective-taking accuracy can be improved among healthy adult samples. Building off of work suggesting that social working memory ({SWM}) capacity (i.e., the ability to maintain and manipulate social cognitive information in mind) predicts perspective-taking skills, we developed a novel {SWM} training intervention to test the hypothesis that {SWM} training improves perspective-taking accuracy. Participants were randomly assigned to complete 12 days of either {SWM} training or nonsocial, ‘‘cognitive working memory’’ ({CWM}) training (active control condition). Perspective-taking accuracy was assessed pre- and posttraining. {SWM} training significantly increased perspective-taking accuracy and these improvements significantly surpassed improvements made by participants who underwent {CWM} training. {SWM} training therefore may be an efficient route toward improved perspective-taking accuracy.},

	abstract = {{EEG} Hyperscanning is a method for studying two or more individuals simultaneously with the objective of elucidating how co-variations in their neural activity (i.e., hyperconnectivity) are inﬂuenced by their behavioral and social interactions. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of different hyper-connectivity measures using (i) simulated data, where the degree of coupling could be systematically manipulated, and (ii) individually recorded human {EEG} combined into pseudo-pairs of participants where no hyper-connections could exist. With simulated data we found that each of the most widely used measures of hyperconnectivity were biased and detected hyper-connections where none existed. With pseudo-pairs of human data we found spurious hyper-connections that arose because there were genuine similarities between the {EEG} recorded from different people independently but under the same experimental conditions. Speciﬁcally, there were systematic differences between experimental conditions in terms of the rhythmicity of the {EEG} that were common across participants. As any imbalance between experimental conditions in terms of stimulus presentation or movement may affect the rhythmicity of the {EEG}, this problem could apply in many hyperscanning contexts. Furthermore, as these spurious hyper-connections reﬂected real similarities between the {EEGs}, they were not Type-1 errors that could be overcome by some appropriate statistical control. However, some measures that have not previously been used in hyperconnectivity studies, notably the circular correlation co-efﬁcient ({CCorr}), were less susceptible to detecting spurious hyper-connections of this type. The reason for this advantage in performance is discussed and the use of the {CCorr} as an alternative measure of hyperconnectivity is advocated.},

Graph analysis of hyper-brain networks constructed from the {EEG} scanning of 26 couples of individuals playing the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma reveals the possibility to predict non-cooperative interactions during the decision-making phase. The hyper-brain networks of twodefector couples have significantly less inter-brain links and overall higher modularity—i.e., the tendency to form two separate subgraphs—than couples playing cooperative or tit-for-tat strategies.

However, given the complex nature of interactions, it has proven difﬁcult to carry out two-person brain imaging experiments in a methodologically feasible and conceptually relevant way. Only a small number of recent studies have put this into practice, using {fMRI}, {EEG}, or {NIRS}. Here, we review two main two-brain methodological approaches, each with two conceptual strategies. The ﬁrst group has employed two-brain {fMRI} recordings, studying (1) turn-based interactions on the order of seconds, or (2) pseudo-interactive scenarios, where only one person is scanned at a time, investigating the ﬂow of information between brains. The second group of studies has recorded dual {EEG}/{NIRS} from two people interacting, in (1) face-to-face turn-based interactions, investigating functional connectivity between theory-of-mind regions of interacting partners, or in (2) continuous mutual interactions on millisecond timescales, to measure coupling between the activity in one person’s brain and the activity in the other’s brain. We discuss the questions these approaches have addressed, and consider scenarios when simultaneous two-brain recordings are needed. Furthermore, we suggest that (1) quantiﬁcation of inter-personal neural effects via measures of emergence, and (2) multivariate decoding models that generalize source-speciﬁc features of interaction, may provide novel tools to study brains in interaction. This may allow for a better understanding of social cognition as both representation and participation.},

Whether this neural synchronization depends on the gender of partner (i.e., opposite or same to the participant) is open to be explored. In current study, we used functional nearinfrared spectroscopy ({fNIRS}) based hyperscanning to study cooperation in a two-person game (female–female, female–male, and male–male) while assaying brain-to-brain interactions. Cooperation was greater in male–male pairs than in female–female pairs, with intermediate cooperation levels for female–male pairs. More importantly, in dyads with partners with opposite gender (female–male pairs), we found signiﬁcant task-related cross-brain coherence in frontal regions (i.e., frontopolar cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) whereas the cooperation in same gender dyads (female–female pairs and male–male pairs) was not associated with such synchronization. Moreover, the changes of such interbrain coherence across task blocks were signiﬁcantly correlated with change in degree of cooperation only in mixed-sex dyads. These ﬁndings suggested that different neural processes underlie cooperation between mixed-sex and same-sex dyadic interactions. Hum Brain Mapp 36:2039–2048, 2015. {VC} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In the present study (N = 54 adult participants), we administered a Level-1 visual perspective task in a dual-task paradigm in which the secondary task required working memory. The results suggest that executive function is associated with both perspective calculation and perspective selection, contrary to previous evidence from similar dual-task studies that had used inhibitory control and attention-based secondary tasks. This contrast may suggest that working memory capacity facilitates perspective-taking.

            Researchers from multiple fields have sought to understand how sex moderates human social behavior. While over 50 years of research has revealed differences in cooperation behavior of males and females, the underlying neural correlates of these sex differences have not been explained. A missing and fundamental element of this puzzle is an understanding of how the sex composition of an interacting dyad influences the brain and behavior during cooperation. Using {fNIRS}-based hyperscanning in 111 same- and mixed-sex dyads, we identified significant behavioral and neural sex-related differences in association with a computer-based cooperation task. Dyads containing at least one male demonstrated significantly higher behavioral performance than female/female dyads. Individual males and females showed significant activation in the right frontopolar and right inferior prefrontal cortices, although this activation was greater in females compared to males. Female/female dyad’s exhibited significant inter-brain coherence within the right temporal cortex, while significant coherence in male/male dyads occurred in the right inferior prefrontal cortex. Significant coherence was not observed in mixed-sex dyads. Finally, for same-sex dyads only, task-related inter-brain coherence was positively correlated with cooperation task performance. Our results highlight multiple important and previously undetected influences of sex on concurrent neural and behavioral signatures of cooperation.},

	abstract = {Objectives Although mindfulness meditation is the familiar and researched form of mental training derived from Buddhism, it represents but one form of practice. Monastic debate is an interactive and dyadic analytical meditation practice that originates from the Tibetan Buddhist tradition where monastics seek to jointly deepen their understanding of complicated philosophical issues. To date, monastic debate and analytic meditation have yet to be examined in the context of scientific investigation.
Methods In the current study, we examined the neural correlates of this analytical meditation practice by means of hyperscanning electroencephalography, a method well-suited for examining social interactions.
Results Consistent with the idea that analytical meditation helps to train concentration, we observed that over the course of the debate, mid-frontal theta oscillations—a correlate of absorption—increased significantly. This increase was stronger for more experienced monks as compared with monks at the beginning of their education. In addition, we found evidence for increases in synchrony in frontal alpha oscillations between paired debaters during moments of agreement as compared with disagreement on a set of premises.
Conclusions Together, these findings provide an initial understanding of Tibetan monastic debate and analytical meditation using neuroscientific methods.},

In some cases this will allow us to replace a high-cost image with a bibliographic reference to that image. Building on the repurposed box content, instructor resources will be overhauled and include a more robust test bank and how-to instructions for incorporating the principles of "test-enhanced learning" into online quizzes that provide real-time feedback for students (implementable with canvas, moodle, and other Web-based course management systems). Other revision work will focus on updated to critical areas to bring the book current with the science, including: Scientific ideas: predictive coding; dynamical systems framing of motor control and its generalization to cognitive control; reinforcement learning; machine learning with an emphasis on deep learning; divisive normalization as a canonical neural computation and its relevance for understanding attention, decision making, and neurological disease (including Autism Spectrum Disorder, epilepsy, etc.). Methodological advances: graph theoretical analyses, resting state functional connectivity, there's also considerable overlap with computational approaches informed by dynamical systems and reinforcement learning perspectives"--},

Misinformation and poor methodology associated with past studies of mindfulness may lead public consumers to be harmed, misled, and disappointed. Addressing such concerns, the present article discusses the difficulties of defining mindfulness, delineates the proper scope of research into mindfulness practices, and explicates crucial methodological issues for interpreting results from investigations of mindfulness. For doing so, the authors draw on their diverse areas of expertise to review the present state of mindfulness research, comprehensively summarizing what we do and do not know, while providing a prescriptive agenda for contemplative science, with a particular focus on assessment, mindfulness training, possible adverse effects, and intersection with brain imaging. Our goals are to inform interested scientists, the news media, and the public, to minimize harm, curb poor research practices, and staunch the flow of misinformation about the benefits, costs, and future prospects of mindfulness meditation.},

	abstract = {Studies have shown that when people are dancing together, they feel more socially connected. We were wondering whether this connection is visible on a neural basis by brains that synchronize. In this thesis, the relationship between inter-brain synchrony and feeling socially connected through movement is investigated. A performance during the Moving Futures Festival where two professional dancers explored various ways to connect, laid the foundation for the laboratory experiment. In this experiment, dyads moved in several social and nonsocial conditions while being hyperscanned by electroencephalography ({EEG}). The mean phase-locking value and imaginary coherence were used to compute inter-brain synchrony. Besides recording brain activity, the participants also reported how connected they felt in each condition. The results showed that the dyads experienced feeling more connected in most of the social conditions compared to the nonsocial conditions. In addition, we found signiﬁcant inter-brain synchrony in various brain areas in the theta and alpha oscillations but not for the oscillations in the beta band. We predicted to see more inter-brain synchrony in the social conditions compared to the nonsocial conditions. We found conditions where this was indeed the case. However, we also found conditions where there was more inter-brain synchrony in the nonsocial conditions compared to the social conditions. Furthermore, we discovered that inter-brain synchrony was affected by several factors, such as gender and the relationship of the dyads. The trends uncovered in the laboratory experiment did not seem to uphold for the inter-brain synchrony of the two professional dancers. The results suggest there exist ways of moving together that make people feel socially connected. Moreover, there is signiﬁcant inter-brain synchrony during movement in various conditions. However, our results did not expose a signiﬁcant relationship between the subjective experience of social connectedness and inter-brain synchrony.},

This continuous mutual adaptation results in interactional synchrony to which both members contribute. Freely exchanging the role of imitator and model is a well-framed example of interactional synchrony resulting from a mutual behavioral negotiation. How the participants’ brain activity underlies this process is currently a question that hyperscanning recordings allow us to explore. In particular, it remains largely unknown to what extent oscillatory synchronization could emerge between two brains during social interaction. To explore this issue, 18 participants paired as 9 dyads were recorded with dual-video and dual-{EEG} setups while they were engaged in spontaneous imitation of hand movements. We measured interactional synchrony and the turn-taking between model and imitator. We discovered by the use of nonlinear techniques that states of interactional synchrony correlate with the emergence of an interbrain synchronizing network in the alpha-mu band between the right centroparietal regions. These regions have been suggested to play a pivotal role in social interaction. Here, they acted symmetrically as key functional hubs in the interindividual brainweb. Additionally, neural synchronization became asymmetrical in the higher frequency bands possibly reflecting a top-down modulation of the roles of model and imitator in the ongoing interaction.},

Large-scale synchronization of neural activity has also been proposed as the neural basis of consciousness. Intriguingly, a growing number of studies in social cognitive neuroscience reveal that phase synchronization similarly appears across brains during meaningful social interaction. Moreover, this inter-brain synchronization has been associated with subjective reports of social connectedness, engagement, and cooperativeness, as well as experiences of social cohesion and ‘self-other merging’. These ﬁndings challenge the standard view of human consciousness as essentially ﬁrst-person singular and private. We therefore revisit the recent controversy over the possibility of extended consciousness and argue that evidence of inter-brain synchronization in the fastest frequency bands overcomes the hitherto most convincing sceptical position. If this proposal is on the right track, our understanding of human consciousness would be profoundly transformed, and we propose a method to test this proposal experimentally.},

	abstract = {Concepts embraced by the term coherence have been identified as central to fields such as quantum physics, physiology, and social science. There are different types of coherence, although the term always implies a harmonious relationship, correlations and connections between the various parts of a system. A specific measure derived from heart rate variability ({HRV}) provides a measure of physiological coherence. Another type of coherence, social coherence, relates to the harmonious alignment between couples or pairs, family units, small groups, or larger organizations in which a network of relationships exists among individuals who share common interests and objectives. A high degree of social coherence is reflected by stable and harmonious relationships, which allows for the efficient flow and utilization of energy and communication required for optimal collective cohesion and action. Social coherence requires that group members are attuned and are emotionally connected with each other, and that the group’s emotional energy is organized and regulated by the group as a whole. A number of studies are reviewed which have explored various types of synchronization in infants, pairs and groups, indicating that feelings of cooperation, trust, compassion and increased prosocial behaviors depends largely on the establishment of a spontaneous synchronization of various physiological rhythms between individuals. This article discusses a new application using {HRV} monitoring in social coherence research and the importance of physiological synchronization in group developmental processes and dynamics. Building on the extensive body of research showing that providing feedback of {HRV} coherence level at the individual level can improve self-regulation, we suggest the following hypotheses: (1) providing feedback of individual and collective {HRV} coherence and the degree of heart rhythm synchronization will increase group coherence, and heart rhythm synchronization among group members. (2) Training in techniques to increase group coherence and heart rhythm synchronization will correlate with increased prosocial behaviors, such as kindness and cooperation among individuals, improved communication, and decreases in social discord and adversarial interactions. (3) Biomagnetic fields produced by the heart may be a primary mechanism in mediating {HRV} synchronization among group members. Data supporting each of the hypothesis is discussed.},

In this study, the authors used a brief loving-kindness meditation exercise to examine whether social connection could be created toward strangers in a controlled laboratory context. Compared with a closely matched control task, even just a few minutes of loving-kindness meditation increased feelings of social connection and positivity toward novel individuals on both explicit and implicit levels.

	abstract = {Significance
            The human dynamic clamp ({HDC}) is proposed as a general paradigm for studies of elementary forms of social behavior in complex biological systems. {HDC} enables parametric control of real-time bidirectional interaction between humans and empirically grounded theoretical models of coordination dynamics. It thus provides necessary experimental access for laboratory investigations, while preserving the reciprocity and open boundary conditions inherent in daily life social interactions. As proof of concept, different implementations are illustrated, ranging from coordination of rhythmic and discrete movements to adaptive and directed behaviors. The {HDC} may be a powerful tool for blending theory and experiment at different levels of description, from neuronal populations to cognition and social behavior.
          , 
            Social neuroscience has called for new experimental paradigms aimed toward real-time interactions. A distinctive feature of interactions is mutual information exchange: One member of a pair changes in response to the other while simultaneously producing actions that alter the other. Combining mathematical and neurophysiological methods, we introduce a paradigm called the human dynamic clamp ({HDC}), to directly manipulate the interaction or coupling between a human and a surrogate constructed to behave like a human. Inspired by the dynamic clamp used so productively in cellular neuroscience, the {HDC} allows a person to interact in real time with a virtual partner itself driven by well-established models of coordination dynamics. People coordinate hand movements with the visually observed movements of a virtual hand, the parameters of which depend on input from the subject’s own movements. We demonstrate that {HDC} can be extended to cover a broad repertoire of human behavior, including rhythmic and discrete movements, adaptation to changes of pacing, and behavioral skill learning as specified by a virtual “teacher.” We propose {HDC} as a general paradigm, best implemented when empirically verified theoretical or mathematical models have been developed in a particular scientific field. The {HDC} paradigm is powerful because it provides an opportunity to explore parameter ranges and perturbations that are not easily accessible in ordinary human interactions. The {HDC} not only enables to test the veracity of theoretical models, it also illuminates features that are not always apparent in real-time human social interactions and the brain correlates thereof.},

	abstract = {Objective: The main obstacle in interpreting {EEG}/{MEG} data in terms of brain connectivity is the fact that because of volume conduction, the activity of a single brain source can be observed in many channels. Here, we present an approach which is insensitive to false connectivity arising from volume conduction.
Methods: We show that the (complex) coherency of non-interacting sources is necessarily real and, hence, the imaginary part of coherency provides an excellent candidate to study brain interactions. Although the usual magnitude and phase of coherency contain the same information as the real and imaginary parts, we argue that the Cartesian representation is far superior for studying brain interactions. The method is demonstrated for {EEG} measurements of voluntary ﬁnger movement.
Results: We found: (a) from 5 s before to movement onset a relatively weak interaction around 20 Hz between left and right motor areas where the contralateral side leads the ipsilateral side; and (b) approximately 2 – 4 s after movement, a stronger interaction also at 20 Hz in the opposite direction.
Conclusions: It is possible to reliably detect brain interaction during movement from {EEG} data. Signiﬁcance: The method allows unambiguous detection of brain interaction from rhythmic {EEG}/{MEG} data. q 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

A signiﬁcant diﬀerence in accuracy was found between low and high {WM} load conditions, which may suggest that {ToM} related tasks use {WM} resources. One neural mechanism that might explain this coordination without communication is the synchronization between brain activity of two people.

In {ASD} participants, functional connectivity was decreased between the frontal pole and the superior frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, precuneus, and anterior/posterior cingulate gyrus. Taken together these results suggest that {ISC} and functional connectivity measure distinct features of atypical brain function in high-functioning autistic individuals during free viewing of acted social interactions.

Two ways in which individual differences in {ToM} might manifest are in the propensity to engage in mental state inference; and the accuracy of those inferences. To examine the accuracy of mental state inferences, a novel {ToM} task was developed, requiring inferences to be made about the mental states of ‘Targets’ during a videoed interview scenario. These inferences were compared to ground truth data provided by the Targets. Participants also made estimates of the Targets’ personality traits. Results demonstrated that trait inferences were used to derive mental state inferences, and that the accuracy of trait estimates predicted the accuracy of mental state inferences. Moreover, relationships between trait and mental state inference varied as a function of the specific mental state inference being made and its relationship to specific traits. Findings are in accordance with the Mind-space theory, that representation of the Target mind is used in the inference of their mental states.},

	abstract = {Studying color preferences provides a means to discover how perceptual experiences map onto cognitive and affective judgments. A challenge is ﬁnding a parsimonious way to describe and predict patterns of color preferences, which are complex with rich individual differences. One approach has been to model color preferences using factors from metric color spaces to establish direct correspondences between dimensions of color and preference. Prior work established that substantial, but not all, variance in color preferences could be captured by weights on color space dimensions using multiple linear regression. The question we address here is whether model ﬁts may be improved by using different color metric speciﬁcations. We therefore conducted a large-scale analysis of color space models, and focused in-depth analysis on models that differed in color space (cone-contrast vs. {CIELAB}), coordinate system within the color space (Cartesian vs. cylindrical), and factor degrees (1st degree only, or 1st and 2nd degree). We used k-fold cross validation to avoid over-ﬁtting the data and to ensure fair comparisons across models. The best model was the 2nd-harmonic Lch model (‘‘{LabC} Cyl2”). Speciﬁed in {CIELAB} space, it included 1st and 2nd harmonics of hue (capturing opponency in hue preferences and simultaneous liking/disliking of both hues on an opponent axis, respectively), lightness, and chroma. These modeling approaches can be used to characterize and compare patterns for group averages and individuals in future datasets on color preference, or other measures in which correspondences between color appearance and cognitive or affective judgments may exist.},

Their goal was to choose matching images without talking nor seeing each other, only using each other’s choices as feedback. Pairs succeeded in matching more often than shuffled participants. Moreover, participants learned to coordinate better over time. Namely, matching performance increased significantly over trials. Successful coordination requires thinking about each other’s beliefs and intentions (theory of mind; {ToM}). Therefore, it was hypothesized that inter-brain synchrony in the alpha band (9-14 Hz) reflected {ToM} processing. Overlapping attentional resources with working memory might impair {ToM} processing. Consequently, it was expected that coordination and synchrony decrease with higher working memory load. In this study a high load n-back task decreased coordination performance, but not inter-brain synchrony. Due to limited {EEG} (one session) and behavioral (four sessions) data, results should be interpreted lightly. However, coordination performance and right parieto-occipital phase locked inter-brain synchrony might be related. This regional synchrony potentially reflects that people learn to attend and integrate similar stimulus features during the task in order to coordinate.},

	abstract = {To understand and predict the behaviour of others, people regularly reason about others’ beliefs, goals, and intentions. People can even use this theory of mind recursively, and form beliefs about the way others in turn reason about the beliefs, goals, and intentions of others. Although the evolutionary origins of this cognitively demanding ability are unknown, the Vygotskian intelligence hypothesis suggests that higher-order theory of mind allows individuals to cooperate more eﬀectively. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis through the Tacit Communication Game. In this game, two agents cooperate to set up novel communication in which a Sender agent communicates the goal to the Receiver agent. By simulating interactions between agents that diﬀer in their theory of mind abilities, we determine to what extent higher orders of theory of mind help agents to set up communication. Our results show that ﬁrst-order and secondorder theory of mind can allow agents to set up communication more quickly, but also that the eﬀectiveness of higher orders of theory of mind depends on the role of the agent. Additionally, we ﬁnd that in some cases, agents cooperate more eﬀectively if they reason at lower orders of theory of mind.},

	abstract = {Permutation tests are amongst the most commonly used statistical tools in modern genomic research, a process by which p-values are attached to a test statistic by randomly permuting the sample or gene labels. Yet permutation p-values published in the genomic literature are often computed incorrectly, understated by about 1/m, where m is the number of permutations. The same is often true in the more general situation when Monte Carlo simulation is used to assign pvalues. Although the p-value understatement is usually small in absolute terms, the implications can be serious in a multiple testing context. The understatement arises from the intuitive but mistaken idea of using permutation to estimate the tail probability of the test statistic. We argue instead that permutation should be viewed as generating an exact discrete null distribution. The relevant literature, some of which is likely to have been relatively inaccessible to the genomic community, is reviewed and summarized. A computation strategy is developed for exact p-values when permutations are randomly drawn. The strategy is valid for any number of permutations and samples. Some simple recommendations are made for the implementation of permutation tests in practice.},

Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain this interpersonal synchrony, but there is no clarity under which conditions it arises, for which signals, or whether there is a common underlying mechanism. We hypothesized that cognitive processing of a shared stimulus is the source of synchrony between subjects, measured here as intersubject correlation ({ISC}). To test this, we presented informative videos to participants in an attentive and distracted condition and subsequently measured information recall. {ISC} was observed for electroencephalography, gaze position, pupil size, and heart rate, but not respiration and head movements. The strength of correlation was co-modulated in the different signals, changed with attentional state, and predicted subsequent recall of information presented in the videos. There was robust within-subject coupling between brain, heart, and eyes, but not respiration or head movements. The results suggest that {ISC} is the result of effective cognitive processing, and thus emerges only for those signals that exhibit a robust brain–body connection. While physiological and behavioral fluctuations may be driven by multiple features of the stimulus, correlation with other individuals is co-modulated by the level of attentional engagement with the stimulus.},

Specifically, we present applications of {fMRI} hyperscanning in the study of social interaction along with promising analysis approaches for {fMRI} hyperscanning, with its high spatial and low temporal resolution. We first review {fMRI} hyperscanning studies in social neuroscience and evaluate the premise of using this costly neuroimaging paradigm. Many second-person social neuroscience studies are possible without {fMRI} hyperscanning. However, certain fundamental aspects of social cognition in real-life social interactions, including different roles of interactors, shared intention emerging through interaction and history of interaction, can be addressed only with hyperscanning. We argue that these fundamental aspects have not often been investigated in {fMRI} hyperscanning studies. We then discuss the implication of the signal coupling found in {fMRI} hyperscanning and consider analysis approaches that make fair use of it. With {fMRI} hyperscanning, we can explore not only synchronous brain activations but whole-brain asymmetric activation patterns with a lagged association between interacting individuals.},

Over the last two decades, a growing number of researchers have adopted a ‘brain-to-brain’ approach, exploring similarities between brain patterns across participants as a novel way to gain insight into the social brain. This methodological shift has facilitated the introduction of naturalistic social stimuli into the study design (e.g. movies) and, crucially, has spurred the development of new tools to directly study social interaction, both in controlled experimental settings and in more ecologically valid environments. Specifically, ‘hyperscanning’ setups, which allow the simultaneous recording of brain activity from two or more individuals during social tasks, has gained popularity in recent years. However, currently, there is no agreed-upon approach to carry out such ‘interbrain connectivity analysis’, resulting in a scattered landscape of analysis techniques. To accommodate a growing demand to standardize analysis approaches in this fast-growing research field, we have developed Hyperscanning Python Pipeline, a comprehensive and easy open-source software package that allows (social) neuroscientists to carry-out and to interpret inter-brain connectivity analyses.},

	abstract = {Until now, in {EEG} studies the activity of the brain during simple or complex tasks have been recorded in a single subject. Often, during such {EEG} recordings, subjects interacts with the external devices or the researchers in order to reproduce conditions similar to the those usually occurring in the real-life. However, in order to study the concurrent activity in subjects interacting in cooperation or competition activities, the issue of the simultaneous recording of their brain activity became mandatory. The simultaneous recording of hemodynamic or neuroelectric activity of the brain is called “hyperscanning”. We would like present results obtained by {EEG} hyperscannings performed on a group of subjects engaged in cooperative games. The {EEG} hyperscannings have been performed with the simultaneous use of high resolution {EEG} devices on groups of three and four subjects while they were playing cooperative games. The analysis of such data have been conducted with analysis method that taken into account the particular nature of the data simultaneously gathered from different subjects.. We called these methods hypermethods. In particular, we estimate the concurrent activity in multiple brains of the group and we depicted the causal connections between regions of different brains (hyperconnectivity). The resulting causality patterns will link certain areas of the brain of a subject to the waveforms obtained from the other brain areas of another subject of the same group. Results obtained in a study of several groups recorded by the hyperscanning reveals causal links between prefrontal areas of the different subjects when they are performing cooperative games in different frequency bands. Hypermethods for hyperscanning will open a different area for the study of neuroscience, in which the activity of multiple brains during social cooperation could be investigated. In such area the importance of {EEG} will be relevant due to its temporal and spatial resolution now obtainable with the high resolution {EEG} techniques.},

One of the manifestations of a basic metarepresentational capacity is a ‘theory of mind’. We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a ‘theory’. If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using Wimmer and Perner’s puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those with Down’s syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism.},

Therefore, the quantification of such synchrony is a crucial topic in brain science research. Furthermore, these cerebral integration processes are likely to involve entire brain areas; therefore, the analysis of multiple couplings is of particular interest. Because phase values are circular variables, it is possible to use circular statistical methods for their examination. In particular, circularcircular correlation coefficients form a suitable measurement to estimate the extent of phase synchronization between different signals. As a multiple circular-circular correlation concept is still pending, two new multiple circular-circular correlation coefficients are presented in this article that can be used to quantify phase couplings between one dependent and an arbitrary number of predictor signals.},

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.08163},
	abstract = {Adaptations to an organism's environment often involve sensory system modifications. In this study, we address how evolutionary divergence in sensory perception relates to the physiological coding of stimuli. Mormyrid fishes that can detect subtle variations in electric communication signals encode signal waveform into spike-timing differences between sensory receptors. In contrast, the receptors of species insensitive to waveform variation produce spontaneously oscillating potentials. We found that oscillating receptors respond to electric pulses by resetting their phase, resulting in transient synchrony among receptors that encodes signal timing and location, but not waveform. These receptors were most sensitive to frequencies found only in the collective signals of groups of conspecifics, and this was correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. Thus, different perceptual capabilities correspond to different receptor physiologies. We hypothesize that these divergent mechanisms represent adaptations for different social environments. Our findings provide the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony.
          , 
            The mormyrids are a family of fish that can generate and detect weak electric fields that they use to navigate and communicate. Each species in this family produces its own distinct shape of electrical signals. Other fish detect these signals using structures called receptors, which then send information to the brain in the form of an electrical nerve impulse.
            Previous research showed that different species of fish respond to different aspects of the electric fields they detect, depending on the receptor types that they have evolved. For example, some species have ‘spiking receptors’ that send a spike of activity to the brain at the start or end of a detected electrical pulse. This allows the fish to detect subtle changes to the shape of the detected electric field. Other species have sensors known as oscillatory receptors; these send a continuous wave of nerve activity to the brain even when no electric field is detected. It is not clear exactly how oscillatory receptors work or what the roles of these different receptor types are.
            Baker et al. have now recorded the activity of the receptors of mormyrid fish as they were exposed to electrical fields that mimic the signals they are normally exposed to in their daily environment. The recordings confirmed previous results that suggest that species with spiking receptors are able to detect variations in the shapes of electrical signals produced by other fish because the receptors produce spikes of activity at the start or end of a detected signal. This response pattern allows their brains to analyze the signal shape.
            In contrast, Baker et al. found that when oscillatory receptors detect a new electric field, they reset their pattern of nerve activity, causing multiple receptors to briefly synchronize their activity. This enables the fish to detect where a signal has been sent from. However, the oscillatory receptors are unable to detect any variations in the shape of the detected electric signal. The oscillatory receptors are most sensitive to certain electric field patterns that are produced by large groups of a single species of fish. Further experiments showed that the fish also change their behavior when these particular electric field patterns are detected.
            Why some species of mormyrids have spiking receptors while others have oscillatory receptors is unknown. It is also unknown how the brain processes oscillatory receptor activity. Future studies will investigate whether these two receptor types may be linked to differences in fish's social behavior, and how the neural networks for processing sensory information differ between the two types of fishes.},

To date, no work has suggested a robust method to estimate a circular-circular correlation coefficient. The present paper aims to propose two robust methods to compute a circular-circular correlation coefficient when the circular data has outliers. The first method is computed based on the circular median, {rMed}, and the second on the circular trimmed mean, {rTrim}. A simulation study is conducted for two circular distributions: the wrapped normal and wrapped Cauchy distributions. The simulation and practical example show that the results of {rMed} are close to the results of classical methods. In contrast, the {rTrim} gives the best results and is the least affected by outliers, even with a high percentage of outliers.},

We have developed and tested a dual electroencephalography ({EEG}) analysis pipeline, namely {DEEP}. Following the preprocessing of the data, {DEEP} allows users to calculate Phase Locking Values ({PLVs}) and cross-frequency {PLVs} as indices of inter-brain phase alignment of dyads as well as time-frequency responses and {EEG} power for each participant. The pipeline also includes scripts to control for spurious correlations.

	abstract = {Spectral analysis methods are now routinely used in electrophysiological studies of human and animal cognition. Although a wide variety of spectral methods has been used, the ways in which these methods differ are not generally understood. Here we use simulation methods to characterize the similarities and differences between three spectral analysis methods: wavelets, multitapers and Pepisode. Pepisode is a novel method that quantiﬁes the fraction of time that oscillations exceed amplitude and duration thresholds. We show that wavelets and Pepisode used side-by-side helps to disentangle length and amplitude of a signal. Pepisode is especially sensitive to ﬂuctuations around its thresholds, puts frequencies on a more equal footing, and is sensitive to long but low-amplitude signals. In contrast, multitaper methods are less sensitive to weak signals, but are very frequency-speciﬁc. If frequency speciﬁcity is not essential, then wavelets and Pepisode are recommended.},

	abstract = {Inter-brain synchronization during social interaction has been linked with several positive phenomena, including closeness, cooperation, prosociality, and team performance. However, the temporal dynamics of inter-brain synchronization during collaboration are not yet fully understood. Furthermore, with collaboration increas­ ingly happening online, the dependence of inter-brain phase synchronization of oscillatory activity on physical presence is an important but understudied question. In this study, physically isolated participants performed a collaborative coordination task in the form of a cooperative multiplayer game. We measured {EEG} from 42 subjects working together as pairs in the task. During the measurement, the only interaction between the par­ ticipants happened through on-screen movement of a racing car, controlled by button presses of both participants working with distinct roles, either controlling the speed or the direction of the car. Pairs working together in the task were found to have elevated neural coupling in the alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands, compared to performance matched false pairs. Higher gamma synchrony was associated with better momentary performance within dyads and higher alpha synchrony was associated with better mean performance across dyads. These results are in line with previous findings of increased inter-brain synchrony during interaction, and show that phase synchronization of oscillatory activity occurs during online real-time joint coordination without any physical co-presence or video and audio connection. Synchrony decreased during a playing session, but was found to be higher during the second session compared to the first. The novel paradigm, developed for the measurement of real-time collaborative performance, demonstrates that changes in inter-brain {EEG} phase syn­ chrony can be observed continuously during interaction.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the benefits of practicing mindfulness have raised much public and academic interest. Mindfulness emphasizes cultivating awareness of our immediate experience, and has been associated with compassion, empathy and various other prosocial traits. However, experimental evidence pertaining to its prosocial benefits in social settings is lacking. In this study, we investigate neural correlates of trait mindfulness during naturalistic dyadic interactions, using both individual brain and inter-brain coupling measures. We used the Muse headset, a portable electroencephalogram ({EEG}) device, to record participants’ brain activity during a {\textasciitilde}10 minutes’ naturalistic dyadic interaction (N = 62) in an interactive art setting. They further completed the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale ({MAAS}) and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index ({IRI}). This allowed us to ask whether inter-brain coupling during naturalistic interactions can be predicted by dyads’ affective traits and trait mindfulness, respectively. First, we failed replicating prior laboratory-based findings with respect to individual brain responses as they relate to mindfulness. Trait mindfulness did, however, predict inter-brain coupling within dyads, in theta ({\textasciitilde}5-8 Hz, p {\textless} 0.001) and beta frequencies ({\textasciitilde}26-27Hz, p {\textless} 0.001). Finally, we found a negative correlation between personal distress and trait mindfulness (t(475) = -5.493, p {\textless} 0.001). These findings underscore the importance of conducting social neuroscience research in ecological settings and enrich our understanding of multi-brain neural correlates of mindfulness during social interaction, while raising critical practical considerations regarding the viability of commercially available {EEG} systems.},

The area allows exploring the commonality of brain dynamics by evaluating the neural synchronization among a group of people performing a speciﬁed task. The growing number of publications on brain-to-brain synchrony inspired the authors to conduct a systematic review using the {PRISMA} protocol so that future researchers can get a comprehensive understanding of the paradigms, methodologies, translational algorithms, and challenges in the area of brain-to-brain synchrony research. This review has gone through a systematic search with a speciﬁed search string and selected some articles based on pre-speciﬁed eligibility criteria. The ﬁndings from the review revealed that most of the articles have followed the social psychology paradigm, while 36\% of the selected studies have an application in cognitive neuroscience. The most applied approach to determine neural connectivity is a coherence measure utilizing phase-locking value ({PLV}) in the {EEG} studies, followed by wavelet transform coherence ({WTC}) in all of the {fNIRS} studies. While most of the experiments have control experiments as a part of their setup, a small number implemented algorithmic control, and only one study had interventional or a stimulus-induced control experiment to limit spurious synchronization. Hence, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this systematic review solely contributes to critically evaluating the scopes and technological advances of brain-to-brain synchrony to allow this discipline to produce more effective research outcomes in the remote future.},

            The mechanisms that underlie social touch analgesia are largely unknown. Here, we apply a hyperscanning approach with real-life interaction of dyads to examine the association between brain-to-brain coupling and pain relief. Our findings indicate that hand-holding during pain increases the brain-to-brain coupling network that correlates with the magnitude of the analgesia and the observer’s empathic accuracy. These findings make a unique contribution to our understanding of physiological mechanisms of touch-related analgesia.

            The mechanisms underlying analgesia related to social touch are not clear. While recent research highlights the role of the empathy of the observer to pain relief in the target, the contribution of social interaction to analgesia is unknown. The current study examines brain-to-brain coupling during pain with interpersonal touch and tests the involvement of interbrain synchrony in pain alleviation. Romantic partners were assigned the roles of target (pain receiver) and observer (pain observer) under pain–no-pain and touch–no-touch conditions concurrent with {EEG} recording. Brain-to-brain coupling in alpha–mu band (8–12 Hz) was estimated by a three-step multilevel analysis procedure based on running window circular correlation coefficient and post hoc power of the findings was calculated using simulations. Our findings indicate that hand-holding during pain administration increases brain-to-brain coupling in a network that mainly involves the central regions of the pain target and the right hemisphere of the pain observer. Moreover, brain-to-brain coupling in this network was found to correlate with analgesia magnitude and observer’s empathic accuracy. These findings indicate that brain-to-brain coupling may be involved in touch-related analgesia.},

            Inter-brain synchronization is enhanced when individuals perform rhythmic interpersonal coordination tasks, such as playing instruments in music ensembles. Experimentally, synchronization has been shown to correlate with the performance of joint tapping tasks. However, it is unclear whether inter-brain synchronization is related to the stability of interpersonal coordination represented as the standard deviation of relative phase ({SDRP}). In this study, we simultaneously recorded electroencephalograms of two paired individuals during anti-phase tapping in three interactive tapping conditions: slow (reference inter-tap interval [{ITI}]: 0.5 s), fast (reference {ITI}: 0.25 s), and free (preferred {ITI}), and pseudo tapping where each participant tapped according to the metronome sounds without interaction. We calculated the inter-brain synchronization between pairs of six regions of interest ({ROI}): frontal, central, left/right temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. During the fast tapping, the inter-brain synchronization significantly increased in multiple {ROI} pairs including temporoparietal junction in comparison to pseudo tapping. Synchronization between the central and left-temporal regions was positively correlated with {SDRP} in the theta in the fast condition. These results demonstrate that inter-brain synchronization occurs when task requirements are high and increases with the instability of the coordination.},

	shorttitle = {Maximum trimmed likelihood estimators},
	abstract = {The likelihood principle is one of the most important concepts in Statistics. Among other things, it is used to obtain point estimators for the parameters of probability distributions of random variables by maximizing the likelihood function. The resulting maximum likelihood estimators usually have desirable properties such as consistency and efficiency. However, these estimators are often not robust as it is known that there is usually a trade-off between robustness and efficiency; the more robust an estimator is the less efficient it may be when the data come from a Gaussian distribution. In this paper we investigate how the estimators change when the likelihood function is replaced by a trimmed version of it. The idea here is to trim the likelihood function rather than directly trim the data. Because the likelihood is scalar-valued, it is always possible to order and trim univariate as well as multivariate observations according to their contributions to the likelihood function. The degree of trimming depends on some parameters to be specified by the analyst. We show how this trimmed likelihood principle produces many of the existing estimators (e.g., maximum likelihood, least squares, least trimmed squares, least median of squares, and m i n i m u m volume ellipsoid estimators) as special cases. Since the resulting estimators may be very robust, they can be used for example for outliers detection. In some cases the estimators can be obtained in closed form. In other cases they may require numerical solutions. In cases where the estimators cannot be obtained in closed forms, we provide several algorithms for computing the estimates. The method and the algorithms are illustrated by several examples of both discrete and continuous distributions. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Mind-wandering refers to the process of thinking task-unrelated thoughts while performing a task. The dynamics of mindwandering remain elusive because it is difficult to track when someone’s mind is wandering based only on behavior. The goal of this study is to develop a machine-learning classifier that can determine someone’s mind-wandering state online using electroencephalography ({EEG}) in a way that generalizes across tasks. In particular, we trained machine-learning models on {EEG} markers to classify the participants’ current state as either mind-wandering or on-task. To be able to examine the task generality of the classifier, two different paradigms were adopted in this study: a sustained attention to response task ({SART}) and a visual search task. In both tasks, probe questions asking for a self-report of the thoughts at that moment were inserted at random moments, and participants’ responses to the probes were used to create labels for the classifier. The 6 trials preceding an off-task response were labeled as mindwandering, whereas the 6 trials predicting an on-task response were labeled as on-task. The {EEG} markers used as features for the classifier included single-trial P1, N1, and P3, the power and coherence in the theta (4–8 Hz) and alpha (8.5–12 Hz) bands at {PO}7, Pz, {PO}8, and Fz. We used a support vector machine as the training algorithm to learn the connection between {EEG} markers and the current mind-wandering state. We were able to distinguish between on-task and off-task thinking with an accuracy ranging from 0.50 to 0.85. Moreover, the classifiers were task-general: The average accuracy in across-task prediction was 60\%, which was above chance level. Among all the extracted {EEG} markers, alpha power was most predictive of mind-wandering.},

We quantified the {EEG} signal for multiple subjects using a representative {EEG} quantification method, and studied the changes in brain activity occurring during collaboration. The proposed method quantifies neural synchronization between subjects through bispectral analysis. We found that phase synchronization between {EEGs} of multi subjects increased significantly during the periods of collaborative work. Traditional methods for a human error analysis used a retrospective analysis, and most of them were analyzed for an unspecified majority.

We developed an analysis approach that discounts spurious correlation of signal power caused by the limited spatial resolution of electrophysiological measures. We applied this approach to source estimates of spontaneous neuronal activity reconstructed from magnetoencephalography ({MEG}). Overall, correlation of power across cortical regions was strongest in the alpha to beta frequency range (8–32 Hz) and correlation patterns depended on the underlying oscillation frequency. Global hubs resided in the medial temporal lobe in the theta frequency range (4–6 Hz), in lateral parietal areas in the alpha to beta frequency range (8–23 Hz), and in sensorimotor areas for higher frequencies (32–45 Hz). Our data suggest that interactions in various large-scale cortical networks may be reflected in frequency specific powerenvelope correlations.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study was aimed at developing a method for extraction and assessment of event-related brain potentials ({ERP}) from single-trials. This method should be applicable in the assessment of single persons’ {ERPs} and should be able to handle both single {ERP} components and whole waveforms.
Methods: We adopted a recently developed {ERP} feature extraction method, the t-{CWT}, for the purposes of hypothesis testing in the statistical assessment of {ERPs}. The t-{CWT} is based on the continuous wavelet transform ({CWT}) and Student’s t-statistics. The method was tested in two {ERP} paradigms, oddball and semantic priming, by assessing individual-participant data on a single-trial basis, and testing the signiﬁcance of selected {ERP} components, P300 and N400, as well as of whole {ERP} waveforms. The t-{CWT} was also compared to other univariate and multivariate {ERP} assessment methods: peak picking, area computation, discrete wavelet transform ({DWT}) and principal component analysis ({PCA}).
Results: The t-{CWT} produced better results than all of the other assessment methods it was compared with.
Conclusions: The t-{CWT} can be used as a reliable and powerful method for {ERP}-component detection and testing of statistical hypotheses concerning both single {ERP} components and whole waveforms extracted from either single persons’ or group data. Signiﬁcance: The t-{CWT} is the ﬁrst such method based explicitly on the criteria of maximal statistical diﬀerence between two average {ERPs} in the time–frequency domain and is particularly suitable for {ERP} assessment of individual data (e.g. in clinical settings), but also for the investigation of small and/or novel {ERP} eﬀects from group data.},

We adopted two context violation {paradigmsFoddball} and {primingFto} study the event-related brain potentials ({ERP}) reﬂecting this recognition process. We found a negative wave, the N300, in the {ERPs} to contextually incongruous exclamations, and interpreted this component as analogous to the well-known N400 response to semantically inappropriate words. The N300 appears to be a real-time psychophysiological measure of spontaneous emotion recognition from vocal cues, which could prove a useful tool for the examination of affective-prosody comprehension. In addition, we developed a new {ERP} component detection and estimation method that is based on the continuous wavelet transform ({CWT}), does not rely on visual inspection of the waveforms, and yields larger statistical difference effects than classical methods.},

	abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efﬁcient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to conﬁgure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks conﬁgured by a pure grid search, we ﬁnd that random search over the same domain is able to ﬁnd models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search ﬁnds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising conﬁguration space. Compared with deep belief networks conﬁgured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional conﬁguration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for conﬁguring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent “High Throughput” methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

	abstract = {Given that we live in highly complex social environments, many of our most important decisions are made in the context of social interactions. Simple but sophisticated tasks from a branch of experimental economics known as game theory have been used to study social decision-making in the laboratory setting, and a variety of neuroscience methods have been used to probe the underlying neural systems. This approach is informing our knowledge of the neural mechanisms that support decisions about trust, reciprocity, altruism, fairness, revenge, social punishment, social norm conformity, social learning, and competition. Neural systems involved in reward and reinforcement, pain and punishment, mentalizing, delaying gratiﬁcation, and emotion regulation are commonly recruited for social decisions. This review also highlights the role of the prefrontal cortex in prudent social decision-making, at least when social environments are relatively stable. In addition, recent progress has been made in understanding the neural bases of individual variation in social decision-making.},

	abstract = {Recent development in diffusion spectrum brain imaging combined to functional simulation has the potential to further our understanding of how structure and dynamics are intertwined in the human brain. At the intra-individual scale, neurocomputational models have already started to uncover how the human connectome constrains the coordination of brain activity across distributed brain regions. In parallel, at the inter-individual scale, nascent social neuroscience provides a new dynamical vista of the coupling between two embodied cognitive agents. Using {EEG} hyperscanning to record simultaneously the brain activities of subjects during their ongoing interaction, we have previously demonstrated that behavioral synchrony correlates with the emergence of inter-brain synchronization. However, the functional meaning of such synchronization remains to be specified. Here, we use a biophysical model to quantify to what extent inter-brain synchronizations are related to the anatomical and functional similarity of the two brains in interaction. Pairs of interacting brains were numerically simulated and compared to real data. Results show a potential dynamical property of the human connectome to facilitate inter-individual synchronizations and thus may partly account for our propensity to generate dynamical couplings with others.},
